# State and Bookmarks

## App state

Top-level state now follows a project-centered model:

```js
{
  activeProjectId,
  projectStateById
}
```

Runtime behavior:

- only the active project's state is rendered
- inactive project states stay in memory

Main implementation:

- [src/App.jsx](/abs/path/c:/Users/m3pan/Desktop/projects/hydromet-map/src/App.jsx)
- [src/lib/appState.js](/abs/path/c:/Users/m3pan/Desktop/projects/hydromet-map/src/lib/appState.js)

## Project state shape

Each project state contains:

```js
{
  view: {
    center,
    zoom,
    bearing,
    pitch,
  },
  basemapId,
  terrainEnabled,
  projection,
  layers,
  raster,
}
```

`raster` may be `null` if a project has no raster family.

## URL bookmarks

The current bookmark URL stores the active project's state.

Encoded fields include:

- `project`
- `basemap`
- `projection`
- `terrain`
- `center`
- `zoom`
- `bearing`
- `pitch`
- `variable`
- `product`
- `ensemble`
- `temporalMode`
- `date`
- `datetime`
- `layers`

Important detail:

The bookmark stores the active project and that active project's visible state. It does not currently serialize the remembered states of other inactive projects.

## Read/write helpers

Bookmark logic lives in:

- [src/lib/appState.js](/abs/path/c:/Users/m3pan/Desktop/projects/hydromet-map/src/lib/appState.js)

Main functions:

- `readStateFromUrl()`
- `writeStateToUrl(state)`

## Status boundary logic

`App.jsx` also applies remote status-based constraints to raster state:

- fetches latest boundary timestamp from `status.json`
- updates default raster date/datetime on first load
- clamps max forecast range
- restricts raster product choices based on time relative to the boundary

This logic currently applies to every project that has a raster family.

## Practical implications

- Project switching preserves in-memory project state.
- Refreshing a bookmarked URL restores the bookmarked project's state.
- Layer visibility and raster selection are project-specific, not global.
